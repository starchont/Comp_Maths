## Project 1:

**1a: The classic Monty Hall problem**

In this program we calculated the probability of the player winning by following different strategies.

***Strategy 1:***

The player does not change the first-selected door.

***Strategy 2:***

The player always changes the door.

**1b: Monty Hall problem and a different strategy**

In this program we calculated the probability of winning.

The player follows the above strategy:

Always selecting the door 1.

If Monty open door 1 the player stays at the door 1.

If Monty open door 3, player changes door 1 and selects door 2.
