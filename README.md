# Computational Mathematics

This repository contains applications of Monte Carlo method. The projects were carried out as part of the course Computational Mathematics II.

## Project 1:

**1a: The classic Monty Hall problem**

In this program we calculated the probability of the player winning by following different strategies.

***Strategy 1:***

The player does not change the first-selected door.

***Strategy 2:***

The player always changes the door.

**1b: Monty Hall problem and a different strategy**

In this program we calculated the probability of winning.

The player follows the above strategy:

Always selecting the door 1.

If Monty open door 1 the player stays at the door 1.

If Monty open door 3, player changes door 1 and selects door 2.

## Project 2:

**2: Romeo and Juliet**

Romeo and Juliet have a date at given time, and each will arrive at the meeting place with a delay between 0 and 1 hour. The first to arrive will wait for 15 minutes and will leave if the other has not arrived yet. In this program we calculated the probability of Romeo and Juliet meeting.

## Project 3:

**3: Exponential Distribution**

In this program we generated random numbers coming from exponential distribution. Then we verified the distribution using Q-Q plot.

## Project 4:

**4: Accept/Reject Algorithm**

In this project we wrote a python code to reproduce the accept/reject algorithm

## Project 5:

**5: Volume of 10-D sphere**

With this code, we computed the volume of 10-dimensional sphere with Monte Carlo method

## Project 6: 

**6: The Ising Model**

In this program we simulated 1-D ising model by using Metropolis Monte Carlo Algorithm.

We created a graph with the mean value of magnitude vs time for different values of temperature.
