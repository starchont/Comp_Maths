## Project 1:

**1a: The classic Monty Hall problem**

In this program we calculated the probability of the player winning by following different strategies.

***Strategy 1:***

The player does not change the first-selected door.

***Strategy 2:***

The player always changes the door.

**1b: Monty Hall problem and a different strategy**

In this program we calculated the probability of winning.

The player follows the above strategy:

Always selecting the door 1.

If Monty open door 1 the player stays at the door 1.

If Monty open door 3, player changes door 1 and selects door 2.

## Project 2:

**Romeo and Juliet**

Romeo and Juliet have a date at given time, and each will arrive at the meeting place with a delay between 0 and 1 hour. The first to arrive will wait for 15 minutes and will leave if the other has not arrived yet. In this program we calculated the probability of Romeo and Juliet meeting.
